# Completions for Node & NPM in the Fish Shell

To set up, move these to your user's completion folder, which is typically ~/.config/fish/completions. The included `copy.fish` script will do this for you.

## Misc Notes

The 'Make completions' script from https://github.com/benhoskings/fish/blob/master/scripts/make_completions.py helped scaffold the Node completions, though its parser choked somewhere and I had to do a lot of manual editing.
